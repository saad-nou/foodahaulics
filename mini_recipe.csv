re. secret dressing: the recipe makes a good amount, so can be enough for larger salads.  it really is a closely-guarded recipe given me by my cousin, who was friends with a chef who swore her to secrecy. however, i think since my promise of secrecy was made over 30 years ago, the statute of limitations has run out! he worked at one of the first very exclusive $$ spa resorts in southern california that still exists... the golden door.  at that time it was the first dressing i had ever had with fresh ginger and i had to drive miles to an asian market to find it and the rice vinegar... times have changed! similar dressings now exist, so i'm sure the spa now has a totally different ""secret"" dressing!","['salad greens', 'green onions', 'salt', 'pepper', 'salad seasoning', 'carrots', 'fresh corn kernels', 'green peppers', 'beets', 'white mushrooms', 'gingerroot', 'rice wine vinegar', 'honey', 'garlic clove', 'soy sauce', 'safflower oil']"

when it came out of the oven, 10 people were standing in my kitchen, and they sort of collectively gasped.  one of our (non-family) guests asked, ""where did you get that turkey?  and what did you do to it?  it looks like something out of a magazine!""  :)

to my absolute delight, it tasted as good as it looked!  everybody said it was the juiciest, most flavorful turkey they'd ever eaten.  so, yeah, ""flipping the bird"" works even when it's the big bird!
